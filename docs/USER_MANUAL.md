Cut regions define which parts of the audio you want to keep.

- **Double-click** anywhere on the waveform
- A new region appears centered on your click position
- This is the fastest method!

### Method 2: Use the "+ Add Region" Button
- Click the **"+ Add Region"** button in the Cut Regions panel
- A new region appears at 10%–40% of the audio

### Adjusting Regions
- **Move a region** — Click and drag the region left/right
- **Resize a region** — Drag the left or right edge of the region
- **Select a region** — Click on it (it will highlight)

### When a region is selected, you can:

- Delete it with the 🗑️ button or `Delete` key
- Play just that region with the ▶️ button next to it

---

## 6. 📋 Managing Regions

### Region List Panel
Below the waveform, you'll find the **Cut Regions** panel showing all your regions:

- Each region shows its **name**, **start time**, **end time**, and **duration**
- **▶️ Play** — Plays just that region's audio
- **🗑️ Delete** — Removes that region

### Undo
- Press **Ctrl+Z** or click "Undo" to reverse your last action
- Works for: adding regions, deleting regions, clearing all regions
- Supports up to **20 undo steps**

### Clear All

- You can undo this with Ctrl+Z

## 7. 🎛️ Audio Effects

Effects are applied to all regions during export:

| Effect | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fade In** | Gradually increases volume at the start (2 seconds) |
| **Fade Out** | Gradually decreases volume at the end (2 seconds) |
| **Normalize** | Adjusts volume to a standard level (-14 dBFS) — great for making quiet audio louder |
| **Reverse** | Plays the audio backwards |

To apply effects:
1. Toggle the effect switches ON (in the effects panel or export panel)
2. They will be applied when you click "Export"

## 11. ❓ FAQ

### Q: What audio formats are supported?
**A:** MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, M4A, AAC, WMA, and any format FFmpeg supports. Video files (MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WebM) are also supported — the audio track will be extracted.

### Q: Is there a file size limit?
**A:** Yes, the maximum file size is **500 MB**. This is configurable by the server administrator.

### Q: Where are my files processed?
**A:** All processing happens on the server. Your files are temporarily stored during processing and can be cleaned up automatically. The app does not store your files permanently.

### Q: Can I record and then edit?
**A:** Yes! Use the "Record Audio" tab to record, then the full waveform editor is available for cutting and effects.

### Q: How do I cut out the middle of a song?
**A:** Create **two regions** — one for the part before the section you want to remove, and one for the part after. Then export as "Merged" to join them together seamlessly.

### Q: Can I use this on my phone?
**A:** Yes! The app is fully responsive and works on mobile browsers. Tap and hold on the waveform to create regions on touch devices.
